# Cascade Integration with CARL

## Description

Implement the integration contract between CARL and Cascade for work item management. This includes the core state propagation engine, registry management, and TreeView updates to work with the new `.cascade/` directory structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] State propagation engine automatically updates parent states
- [ ] Registry manager handles work-item-registry.json operations
- [ ] TreeView displays items from .cascade/ directory
- [ ] File watcher monitors state.json files
- [ ] Progress calculation works correctly

## Dependencies

- Depends on: None (foundational epic)
- Blocks: Future epics for advanced features

## Children

- F0001: State Propagation Engine
- F0002: Registry Management (planned)
- F0003: TreeView Modernization (planned)

## Execution Strategy

- **Parallel execution possible**: No (features have dependencies)
- **Prerequisites**: Test fixtures, sample data structure
- **Estimated effort**: 4 weeks

## Technical Notes

- Uses VSCode file system watcher API
- Implements recursive state propagation algorithm
- Debounces file changes to prevent excessive updates
- Validates state.json schema before propagation
