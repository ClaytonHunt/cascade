- [ ] Phase 1: Design phase completed
- [ ] Phase 2: Implementation phase in progress
- [ ] Progress rolls up correctly through phases

## Children

- PH0001: Design Phase
- PH0002: Implementation Phase

## Notes

This story demonstrates the optional Phase layer in the hierarchy.
Phases are useful for organizing larger stories into sequential steps.
