# Implement state loading logic

## Description

Create function to load and parse state.json files with proper error handling.

## Implementation

```typescript
async function loadState(statePath: string): Promise<StateData> {
  // Read file
  // Parse JSON
  // Validate schema
  // Return StateData object
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Read state.json file from disk
- [x] Parse JSON with error handling
- [x] Validate required fields (id, status, progress, children, updated)
- [x] Return typed StateData object
- [x] Handle missing file gracefully
- [x] Handle malformed JSON gracefully

## Notes

This is a leaf node (Task) - no directory, no state.json for this item itself.
Tasks are tracked in their parent Story's state.json file.
