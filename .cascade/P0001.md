# Cascade VSCode Extension

## Description

VSCode extension for hierarchical work item tracking and automated state propagation. Provides visual kanban-style tracking with real-time synchronization between CARL and the extension UI.

## Objectives

- Provide visual work item tracking UI in VSCode
- Automatically propagate state changes from child to parent items
- Enable navigation and exploration of work item hierarchy
- Integrate seamlessly with CARL orchestration system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Extension activates for `.cascade/` directories
- [ ] State propagation works automatically on file changes
- [ ] TreeView displays work items from registry
- [ ] Progress bars show accurate percentages
- [ ] Validation detects and reports errors

## Dependencies

- VSCode API 1.80.0+
- Node.js 16+
- TypeScript 5.0+

## Execution Strategy

- **Parallel execution possible**: Yes (multiple epics can be developed independently)
- **Prerequisites**: VSCode extension infrastructure, test framework
- **Estimated effort**: 3 months

## Notes

This project integrates with CARL (Coding Assistant for Rapid Launch) which is responsible for creating and updating work items. Cascade watches for changes and propagates state upward through the hierarchy.
